Greeting Slack,

Thank you for allowing me to do the challenge.
I was not able to complete but hope my project shows that I do know how to response to http requests and structure applictions in a right manner.

Since I was pressed on time these where the next things I planned to accomplish:

1. Use Active Record in Rails to save the board after each turn, since I was trying to figure out how to make the data remain persistent

2. Use cookies / Active Record to keep track of if a current game was being played
3. Take User input and allow them to place results on the board
